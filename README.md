# Skills-Up-Youth
Overview
Welcome to Skills-Up YOUth!, a web-based application designed to break down barriers and empower underprivileged youths (aged 15-35) by providing accessible technology-related educational resources and connecting them with lucrative job opportunities. In many communities, financial instability and fractured family environments limit access to quality education, perpetuating social and income inequality.
